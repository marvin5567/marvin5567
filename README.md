# 💫 about me:
🔭 I'm working on a discord AI bot in Python that will contain stock data analysis, ethical hacking tools, etc. <br>👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any game development projects in Unity and any Python projects (involving GPT API would be preferable)<br>🤝 I’m looking for help with algorithms since they have never been my strong suit; moreover, my code is not super pretty or optimal in my eyes, I like to really experiment a ton<br>🌱 I’m currently learning game dev in Unity, cyber-security, AI (GPT API and general concepts), and chaos theory (attempting to apply in Python with matplotlib)<br>💬 You could generally ask me about Python concepts and anything related to AI and I'd be able to answer super comfortably, and game development also just nothing too complex<br>⚡ I love ducks
